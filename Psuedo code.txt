A distributed Genetic Algorithm (dGA) involves multiple subpopulations that evolve independently but periodically exchange information to promote diversity and enhance exploration. Below is a pseudocode outline for a basic distributed Genetic Algorithm:

```python
Initialize a set of subpopulations, each with its own population of individuals:
For each subpopulation:
    Initialize a random population of individuals

Repeat for a fixed number of generations or until convergence:
    For each subpopulation:
        Evaluate the fitness of each individual in the subpopulation
    
    For each subpopulation:
        Select parents for reproduction using selection methods (e.g., tournament selection)
        Apply crossover and mutation operators to create offspring
    
    Exchange information between subpopulations periodically:
    For each subpopulation:
        Share a fraction of individuals with neighboring subpopulations
        Receive individuals from neighboring subpopulations
    
    For each subpopulation:
        Replace some individuals with offspring and received individuals
        Maintain the best individuals based on fitness (optional: use an elitism strategy)
    
    Evaluate convergence criteria (e.g., maximum number of generations or desired fitness level)

# Standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) Pseudocode

Initialize a population of individuals:
For each individual:
    Initialize a random set of genes (solution representation)

Repeat for a fixed number of generations or until convergence:
    For each individual in the population:
        Evaluate the fitness of the individual based on the problem
    
    Create an empty mating pool:
    For each individual in the population:
        Calculate the selection probability for the individual based on its fitness
        Add the individual to the mating pool based on its selection probability
    
    Create a new population through reproduction:
    While the new population is not full:
        Select two parents from the mating pool (e.g., roulette wheel or tournament selection)
        Apply crossover (recombination) to create one or more offspring
        Apply mutation to the offspring with a certain probability
        Add the offspring to the new population
    
    Replace the old population with the new population
    
    Evaluate convergence criteria (e.g., maximum number of generations or desired fitness level)
